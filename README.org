* Introduction

   Running an E-commerce operation shouldn't be rocket science. We should
   be able to handle increased load indefinitely without the servers
   melting down on a peak day. In fact all we really should need is a
   website, a payment processor (we are using [[https://stripe.com][Stripe]]) and a bare minimum
   of code to get started.

   In this example we will be building an website that sells a book.  It
   is a completely serverless architecture powered by [[https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/][AWS Lambda]]. With
   AWS's [[https://aws.amazon.com/free/][Free Tier]] except for the Stripe transaction fees the cost of
   running this infrastructure should be *near zero dollars* during the
   first year.

* Tools

  We will be using the following technologies to run our E-commerce
  site:

  - [[https://www.cloudflare.com][Cloudflare]]
  - [[https://aws.amazon.com/s3/][AWS S3]]
  - [[https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/][AWS DynamoDB]]
  - [[https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/][AWS Lambda]]
  - [[https://stripe.com][Stripe]]

  We will be using S3 to host our Website, Cloudflare for https and CDN,
  DynamoDB to keep track of our transactions, Lambda for processing the
  transactions and creating a charge.

* IAM Role

   Before we get started we need to create an IAM role that we will be
   using on the website that allows invoking Lambda fuctions.

   Follow [[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html][this guide]] for creating an IAM role. Attach the following user
   policy to that IAM account. Replace the =YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER= with
   your AWS account number. What this does is say that the account can
   only invoke the AWS Lambda function named =ackin_store_example-dev=
   and nothing else.

   To do this you need to create an IAM Policy that can then be attached
   to a new IAM user. This is the policy document:

* Backend

** DynamoDB Table

   Create a AWS DynamoDB Table with the default settings. We'll name it
   =AcksinStoreTransactions= with the default key being =customerId= and
   a string type.

** AWS Lambda Function

   The AWS Lambda function does the following:

   - It receives the =stripeToken=
   - It creates a Stripe Customer and stores it in our DynamoDB.
   - It charges the customer.
   - It returns a link to our content.

*** AWS Lambda Policy

     Here is the Policy file that we need to attach to the function. As
     always replace =YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER== with your AWS Account
     number.

#+include: AcksinStoreExamplePolicy.json src json

* Website

  To process transactions we should do everything on an https enabled
  site. Unfortunately, https costs money especially when you want to
  just try out to see if something works. Fortunately for this we can
  use [[https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/][Cloudflare]] as the CDN to our AWS S3 website. Cloudflare also
  provides a free SSL certificate for free.

** Webpage

   Here is an extremely simple Bootstrap powered site featuring a credit
   card form. We will be selling a book on the site. Store it as
   =index.html=. As you can see we are including the AWS JS SDK which is
   what we are using to invoke our Lambda function.

#+INCLUDE: www/index.html src html

** JavaScript

   Here is the corresponding JavaScript for the site. Store it as
   =js/config.js= and =js/serverless-ecommerce.js=. Get the security
   credentials from the user you generated and fill in the region that
   you hosted your AWS Lambda in. Also get your Stripe key and fill it
   in.
